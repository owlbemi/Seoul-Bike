## Packages Used
The following R packages were used in this project:

- ggplot2: Package for visualization
- dplyr: Package for data manipulation
- reshape2: Package for data transformation
- tidyr: Package for data cleaning
- raster: Package for handling map data
- ggmap: Package for creating maps using Google Maps API

## Project Progress
The project was conducted in the following order:

1. Data collection and cleaning
2. Data analysis
3. Visualization of analysis results
4. Suggesting improvement measures based on analysis results
   
## Data Analysis
Using the cleaned data, I've analysed the usage of Seoul's Ttareungee. The analysis contents are as follows:

- Usage status by time zone
- Usage status by day of the week
- Usage status by district
- Foreigner usage status
- Usage status by population
- Improvement Measures Based on Analysis Results

## Based on the analysis results, I've proposed improvement measures for the Ttareungee service. The proposed improvement measures are as follows:

- Provide rental station usage status by time zone to improve user convenience.
- Provide rental station usage status by day of the week to help users plan their usage.
- Provide rental station usage status by district to understand the usage status of Ttareungee by region.
- Analyze foreigner usage status and provide customized services for foreign users.
- Expand the number of rental stations focusing on areas with low usage.

## Limitations of the Project
The analysis method is simple, and more complex analysis is needed.
The data used is limited, and more diverse data is needed.
